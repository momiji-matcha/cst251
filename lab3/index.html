	<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
		<p>The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure and add index.html files. </p>

	<h2>Challanges</h2>
		<p>It was difficult to understand the parent/child system at first, but now everything makes a lot more sense. This system is very effective and I confidently feel like I can link back to files in HTML.</p>

	<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Here are the screenshots of our results:</p2>
