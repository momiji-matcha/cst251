	<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>I personaly had trouble understanding the concept of divs. I remember learning about them last week, but I didn't realize how important they would be. I eventually figured them out (I think).
			I don't understand why certain tags need to be broken up so many times (ie. your image transition on your homepage), why can't everything be contained under the same tag?</p>

		<p>CSS is super important to the layout of a webpage. It's the difference between and clunky 90s webpage and a modern chique one. It's amazing how much it can do.</p>
