	<h1>Lab 5: More HTML</h1>
		<p>In this lab, we created a webpage with several images and links.</p>
		<br>
		Plain images:
		<br>
		<h3>My cockatiel, Fransua. He is a high white pied with a dirty face.</h3>
			<img src="img/fransua_2.jpg" alt="Fransua being cute."width=300>
    <h3>Parrots like to be pet too, you just have to earn their trust.</h3>
			<img src="img/fransua_1.jpg" alt="Fransua being pet."width=300>
		<br>
		<h3>Links cleverly disguised as images:</h3>
		<br>
			<a href="https://csumb.edu/"><img src="img/csumb_logo.png" alt="The CSUMB logo."height=100></a>
    	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIMLoLxmTDw"><img src="img/black.jpg" alt="Black rectangle."height=100></a>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>I struggled with making images into links. At first, all of the text underneith the link would turn into a hyperlink and the image I inserted wouldn't even be visible. I wasn't using enough angle brackets, so the link was bleeding out.</p>

	<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>I think we will do a good job.</p>
