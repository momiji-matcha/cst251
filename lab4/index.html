	<h1>Lab 4: File Transfer</h1>
		<p>This lab went over how to transfer files from the local server to the worldwide server.</p>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>At first, I couldn't figure ot why my website wasn't displaying on Github desktop. I had 2 indexes in my cst251 folder and it wasn't pulling from the right one for some reason. My parter helped me properly name and push the files to the origin.</p>

	<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>I can now see my website on the Github server.</p>
