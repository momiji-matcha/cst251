	<h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>I was not available to work on the proejct, but I used the 3 other ideas though of by my teammates as a base for my sketches.</p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>They only made one prototype, so I just kinda came up with everything. I am NOT very good at web design, and I have no previous
		experience in it. Information architecture is not my strong suit, but I would like to get better at it. It was very difficult for me
		to come up with 3 different sketches for each topic, but I got thorugh it.</p>
